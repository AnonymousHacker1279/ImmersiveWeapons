This minor update swaps the biome library once more to improve compatibility in modpacks.

### Feature Changes / Additions

- Replace overworld biome implementation (Battlefields)
    - Biolith has been replaced by TerraBlender (which had replaced BiomeSquisher previously)
    - This should improve compatibility with packs that are already using TerraBlender
