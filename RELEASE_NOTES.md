This minor update includes a handful of bugfixes and tweaks.

### Feature Changes / Additions

- Tossing a Hans' Blessing into a fire block will now summon a Super Hans while inside a tower structure, allowing him
  to be easily respawned instead of having to find multiple towers
- Loot table changes:
	- Champion Tower chests have been rebalanced slightly to make the rare items less rare
	- Super Hans now has a pool to include the three accessory items which were previously only accessible through
	  champion tower chests, and has a pool to occasionally drop Kill Counters
	- Hans now has a pool to rarely drop Kill Counters, and no longer has a pool to drop leather
	- Celestial Towers now roll each pool based on the number of players that dealt damage, similar to
	  Super Hans

### Bugfixes

- Fix enchantment tooltips at the max Skygazer level not being colored correctly when a Skygazer has not been loaded
  into the world
- Adjust texture for Champion Base blocks to improve compatibility with mods like Rubidium
- Added missing advancements for some content in the last update, as well as updating some other old advancements
