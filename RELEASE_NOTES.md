This release includes a few new items, along with bugfixes and other improvements. Additionally, it moves the mod to
NeoForge. No new releases will be designed for the classic Forge modloader.

At the present moment, the mod may be compatible with both NeoForge and classic Forge, but this is not guaranteed to
work. If you encounter issues on Forge, please try using NeoForge first.
