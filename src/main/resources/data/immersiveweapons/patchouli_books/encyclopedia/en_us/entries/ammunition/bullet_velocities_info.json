			"text": "All bullets have a bonus applied for their velocity at the time of impact. The formula for this bonus is as follows:$(br2)$(l)delta distance vector length x base damage$()$(br2)The maximum damage is clamped at $(l)2.147483647E9D$(), so if a bullet happens to accelerate some absurd amount, it won't deal more damage than this."

			"text": "Every time you fire a firearm, you have a $(l)10%$() chance for a bullet to be critical. The critical bonus is as follows:$(br2)$(l)random(current damage / 2 + 2)$()$(br2)Then, the critical bonus is added to the current damage. If the damage were to somehow exceed $(l)2147483647L$(), then it stops adding more."
