			"text": "If the process is interrupted via breaking of the synthesizer, then your ingredients will be dropped. You will lose the fuel.$(br2)Since the process takes so long, and you cannot move it while it is processing, I recommend putting it in a safe place away from other players that might want to prevent you from obtaining Tesla-level gear."
