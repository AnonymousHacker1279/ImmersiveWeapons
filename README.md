## A vanilla+ weapons mod for Minecraft 1.17.1/1.16.5/1.16.4/1.15.2

Immersive Weapons is a vanilla+ weapons add-on aiming to spice up your combat skills.

Traverse the world, scavenging in destroyed factories or climbing to the pits of hell to collect new and powerful
resources. Build stronger and more versatile weapons of war. Fortify your base and sound alarms at the first sign of
intrusion by invaders.

A few things that will be the highlight of your experience:

- Tiered Pikes, so you can stab someone from way over there
- Flintlock Pistol and Blunderbuss, so you can shoot someone from way over there
- New and Powerful Swords, so you can slice someone that isn't way over there
- Medical Equipment, so you can survive getting stabbed, shot, and sliced
- Environmental Traps, so you can stop people from coming over to stab, shoot, and slice you

A few other notes:

- I only intend to work on the latest versions of Minecraft. Don't ask about porting to old versions.
- This is for the Forge modloading platform. No, I don't plan to port to Fabric, don't ask about it.
- Yes, you can include it in modpacks, provided it is open source and doesn't have an installer.
- This is open source. If you want to port to old versions or to Fabric, do it yourself.
- This is NOT to be reposted to any mod rehosting websites. The only places you should download this mod at are the CurseForge page, and this GitHub repository. #StopModReposts
