# ImmersiveWeapons Mod for Minecraft 1.16.2
## A (currently) small vanilla+ weapons mod for Minecraft 1.15.2/1.16.2
1.15.2 is the recommended version as of now, since it supports the most features. Active development is focused on 1.16.2. Currently, ore/structure generation is missing in the latest 1.16.2 build due to the lack of Forge support. The previous functionality in 1.15.2 will be re-implemented in the 1.16.2 build once Forge updates.

The 1.15.2 build was compiled with Forge 31.2.36.

The 1.16.2 build was compiled with Forge 33.0.21.
